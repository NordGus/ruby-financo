# Abstract

## Designing financo's core: Accounts and Transactions.

The way Accounts and Transactions are designed is like a graph, where Accounts are the graph's
nodes, and the Transactions are its edges.

## Accounts
Accounts are containers that can represent a capital store or wallet in the system, debts held 
or incurred, available credit or any source of income or expense.

| field       | type                | additional            |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| id          | uuid                | primary key           |
| parent_id   | uuid                | index                 |
| kind        | text                | index, not null       |

| description | text                |                       |
| color       | text                | not null              |
| capital     | biginteger (64 bit) | not null, default `0` |
| archived_at | timestamp           | index                 |
| deleted_at  | timestamp           | index                 |
| created_at  | timestamp           | not null              |
| updated_at  | timestamp           | not null              |

An Account can have a parent account vía the `parent_id`. This is a design decision made, so the
user can define child accounts, so they can better classify their finances inside the system's
limitations.

Every Account must have a `kind`, that will be treated as an enum to indicate the type of account
stored in the system. The values should be defined as `{family}.{type}`. Where family would be 
one of the following `system`, `capital`, `debt`, `external`.
As for the types, each family would have their own:
- `system`
  - `history`
- `capital`
  - `normal`
  - `savings`
- `debt`
  - `personal`
  - `loan`
  - `credit`
- `external`
  - `income`
  - `expense`

This should be enforced on a database level.

All Accounts must have a `currency`, that will be treated as an enum, or at least be normalized 
to a defined list of values to indicate the `currency` stored or handled by the account stored 
in the system. This would indicate the system if the user should indicate the amount received by the
target account to store as the transaction's exchange rate and maintain system coherency.

Accounts must have a `capital`, this value will be used on `debt` family Accounts to define the 
credit limit for `debt.credit` Accounts or the amount owed/own for `debt.loan` Accounts. For all 
other Accounts' `kind` this value should be `0` for normalization purposes and for future
flexibility.

The field `archived_at` is a mechanism to communicate that an Account is no longer in use or closed,
but all transactions to and from it continue to be present in the transaction listings. Being a 
`timestamp` field it should be `null` when the Account is not archived, and store a timestamp when
it is.

For deletion, each Account can have a timestamp `deleted_at` to indicate it was deleted form the 
system, and it will be completely removed on later time.

For UI customization each account stores a `color` value. This values are always present, 
`color` indicate to the UI the theming around the respective Account. This value is selected from 
a limited list of options programmatically defined in the application.

## Transactions
Transactions are time series-like records that connect money movements between
[Accounts](#accounts).

| field         | type                | additional                               |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| id            | uuid                | primary key                              |
| source_id     | uuid                | foreign key to accounts, index, not null |
| target_id     | uuid                | foreign key to accounts, index, not null |
| source_amount | biginteger (64 bit) | not null                                 |
| target_amount | biginteger (64 bit) | not null                                 |
| notes         | text                |                                          |
| issued_at     | date                | index, not null                          |
| executed_at   | date                | index                                    |
| deleted_at    | timestamp           | index                                    |
| created_at    | timestamp           | not null                                 |
| updated_at    | timestamp           | not null                                 |

All Transactions need to reference a *Source* Account and a *Target* Account, vía `source_id` 
and `target_id`. These relations need to be validated to prevent a circular reference where 
*Source* Account and *Target* Account are the same.

As well, every Transaction, needs to include a `source_amount` and `target_amount` fields to store
the Transaction's amount, the reason there are two separate values, is because the *Source* 
Account and the *Target* Account not necessarily share the same `currency`, so this is used to 
store the Transaction's effective conversion rate. So, if *Source* Account and *Target* Account 
share the same `currency` both, `source_amount` and `target_amount`, must be equal. And if 
*Source* Account and *Target* Account `currency` are different, `source_account` and 
`target_amount` should be different, storing the amounts for each Account `currency` of the 
Transaction.

Every Transaction must have an `issued_at` date, this date represents the date that the 
Transaction was issued from the *Source* Account, ergo when the money left. At the same time it also 
have a `executed_at` date, this date represents the date that the Transaction was executed by 
the *Target* Account's institution, ergo when the money arrived. The difference between 
`issued_at` and `executed_at` represents the lag/fly time of the Transaction. `executed_at` must 
be greater than or equal to `issued_at` when set.

For deletion, each Account can have a timestamp `deleted_at` to indicate it was deleted form the 
system, and it will be completely removed on later time.
